# Proof of concept for auto-generated test sheets

Goal: to reduce the amount of work required to keep all of the test sheets
up to date when changes are made.  Plus, they need to look prettier.

Ideally, one would be able to modify the spreadsheet describing the techniques
and all of the belt test sheets would be generated from that spreadsheet.

Additionally, supplemental sheets and a test-caller's script could be generated
as desired.  Everything should be in a PDF for accessibility and 

As an escape hatch, a .docx should be generated for everything in the event that
we move away from this system to allow manual editing.
